# LearnbyDoing.Angular

## Project Overview

This repository contains two applications that demonstrate Angular fundamentals and .NET Web API integration.

### Angular Application

The Angular application is a Task Management system with CRUD operations. Users can:
- Create tasks
- Edit tasks
- Delete tasks

Each task includes:
- Title
- Description
- Status
- Start date
- End date

### .NET Web API Application

The .NET Web API application handles the backend operations for the Angular app. It follows a layered architecture with the following layers:
- Core
- Infrastructure
- Application

The application uses an MSSQL database with a code-first approach and migrations.

### Key Features

- Best practices such as interfaces and services are implemented.
- Task service is used in the API controllers to handle operations.

### Project Aim

The aim of this project is to learn how to develop an Angular application that consumes Web API endpoints to perform CRUD operations.
